# Final Lab Task 2 Transforming ER into Relational Tables

In this laboratory task, we were given a sample Entity-Relationship (ER) model and tasked with converting it into a relational database using MySQL. We were required to identify the appropriate entities and attributes to ensure the structure is functional, as well as define the necessary primary and foreign keys to establish proper relationships between tables.
